# DIY Spotify Wrapped 
 Using my 2024 Spotify Data to create a visual in PBI.

***What is Spotify Wrapped?*** <br>
Spotify Wrapped is a feature available to Spotify premium users that tells the user about their listening history in the corresponding year.
The metrics are usually the same each year, such as your top 5 artists and songs of the year, how many minutes you have listened to, and your most played genre.

 ***Inspiration*** <br>
 I am an avid user of Spotify and I am always excited to see (and flex) my Spotify wrapped to my friends. 
 I thought it would be a cool idea to create my own version of Spotify wrapped using Power BI, as it is a tool that many employers use in the field in which I'm interested in.

***Goals*** <br>
Before starting this project, I wanted to know a few things about my listening history this year:
1. Which artists have you listened to the most this year? (could split this into 4 quarters (or a slider for the user to see) as my music listening changes a lot)
2. Which songs have you listened to the most this year? (could split this into 4 quarters (or a slider for the user to see) as my music listening changes a lot)
3. What times of the day were you most active on Spotify?
4. What songs have I skipped the most?
5. What was my main method of listening (from a playlist, autoplay, my liked songs, etc)
